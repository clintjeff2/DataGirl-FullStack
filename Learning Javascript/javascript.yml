The Script Tag:
We use the "script" tag to write javascript code
e.g 
<script>

</script>

Comments:
Single line and Multi line comments
- For Single line we use //
- For Multi line we use /* code here */

Variables:
- Containers for storing values
- Variable declaration and definitions
- Declarations lets the browser know the variable exist
- Definition lets the browser know what that variable stores
- Can use var, let, const to declare and define variables

OPERATORS: 

Arithmetic Operators:
Operator	Description
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
**	Exponentiation (ES2016)
/	Division
%	Modulus (Division Remainder)
++	Increment
--	Decrement

Assignment Operators:
Operator Example	Same As
=	        x = y	    x = y
+=	      x += y	  x = x + y
-=	      x -= y	  x = x - y
*=	      x *= y	  x = x * y
/=	      x /= y	  x = x / y
%=	      x %= y	  x = x % y
**=	      x **= y	  x = x ** y

Comparison Operators: 
Operator	Description
==	      equal to
===	      equal value and equal type
!=	      not equal
!==	      not equal value or not equal type
>	        greater than
<	        less than
>=	      greater than or equal to
<=	      less than or equal to
?	        ternary operator

Logical Operators:
Operator	Description
&&	        logical and
||	        logical or
!	          logical not

DATA TYPES:
- Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types
- e.g of Primitive Data types (String, Number, Boolean);
- e.g of Non-Primitive Data type(Object, Arrays, undefined)
- Objects ---> They store data in key:value pairs
- Arrays ----> They are used to store data of the same type.:
	* Could be an array of objects 
	* Could be an array of numbers
	* Could be an array of strings etc.

OBJECTS:
- A car has properties like weight and color, and methods like start and stop
- We can use objects to achieve the creation of a car model for instance.
- Objects are written in key value pairs (key: "value")
- Each key value pair is seperated from the next with the help of a comma ","
- keys and values are seperated using the colon sign ":"
- And finally, objects are enclosed in curly brackets "{}"
- e.g of a table object is 
let chair = {
	color: 'brown',
	height: 1,
	weight: 50,
	legs: 4,
};
